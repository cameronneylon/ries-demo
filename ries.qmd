## Presentation

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more
- Learn more at: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/>

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
# Imports and Loaders

import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import process

era = pd.read_csv(process.df_outpath)
era2 = era[len("idx_for") == 2]
era4 = era[len("idx_for") == 4]
```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
